Developed a domain-specific sentiment analysis framework leveraging the LLaMA 7B language model fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter efficiency. Utilized instruction-based tuning on 10,501 samples from Twitter Financial News and FiQA datasets, with validation on 2,388 samples and testing on the Financial PhraseBank (4,840 samples). Achieved state-of-the-art performance with 82.5% accuracy and a 0.717 F1 score on social media financial texts, outperforming models like FinBERT and ChatGPT-4. Implemented a rule-based post-processing step to map generative outputs to sentiment labels. Future enhancements include integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms to improve contextual understanding and adaptability.
